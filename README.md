# Pathfinding Visualizer Project

This project is a web-based pathfinding visualizer that allows users to interactively explore and visualize various pathfinding algorithms and maze generation techniques.

## Algorithms Implemented

The following pathfinding algorithms are implemented in the project:

1. **A* Search Algorithm**
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
4. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

## Maze Generation Algorithms

The project also includes maze generation algorithms:

1. **Randomized Maze**
2. **Randomized Depth-First Search Maze**
3. **Recursive Division Maze**

## Encountered Issues or Challenges

While developing this project, the main issues were suprinsingly related to the UI. They were a bit tedious to fix, but I enjoyed the process and fixing issues related to UI is why I chose to do this project in React. I expected to have issues with the algorithms themselves, but those didn't turn out to be so complicated and there was a good number of online resources to reference. It was a struggle initially to use Javascript instead of Python, but that is the reason I chose to do, in order to challenge myself. The main UI issues were:

- **Rendering and Animation:** Achieving smooth and responsive animations for visited nodes and the shortest path.
- **User Interaction:** Implementing user-friendly interactions for creating walls, moving start and end nodes, and resetting the board.

## Code Execution Instructions

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application with `npm start`.
4. Open the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Information

- **Animation Speed:** Adjust the animation speed using the "Fast," "Average," and "Slow" buttons.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different algorithms and maze generation. Happy pathfinding!# AlgoVisualizer
